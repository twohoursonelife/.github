# Two Hours One Life

A fork of the Open Source game One Hour One Life.
Otherwise known as 2HOL, we're made by and for the community.

## We need your help to survive
If you're reading this, you likely have some amount of technical or industry experience.

Our core codebase is C++ mixed with PHP, but it's all of our "satellite" or smaller applications that we need the most assitance with.

If you can spare a few hours a week, join the Discord and make yourself known, ideally becoming somewhat involved in the community.

You can pick an issue to own or ask for direction on what needs priority.

We have tasks encompasing:
- Project management
  - General organisation management
- Community engagement
- C++
- PHP
- NodeJS
- VueJS
- discord.py
- discord.js
